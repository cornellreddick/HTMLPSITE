        <p>
            Hello Everyone! I'm <strong>Cornell</strong>. I started learning how to code June of 2017 and it has changed my world. The Fundamental of Computer Programming
            with C# (The Bulgarian C# Book by Svetlin Nako, Veseline Kolev & Co.) is what I started with.
            On Feburary 2018 I took an 18 week course know as the Microsoft Software and System course (<a href="https://military.microsoft.com/programs/mssa/">MSSA</a>) where I learned Cloud Application Development. 
            I had hands on training in C#, SQL, Azure, HTML, and CSS. I graduate from the course on June 26, 2018.
